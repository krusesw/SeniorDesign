We will combine our passions for gaming and artificial intelligence to create an interesting and entertaining experience. We plan to use unreal engine to develop a new game from scratch, incorporating AI in our game. This game will consist of a single player versus a cpu that learns over time. Ideas for AI controled aspects are: enemies, balancing, and level generation. From this game we will be able to determine feasibility of self artificially intelligent systems in gaming.
