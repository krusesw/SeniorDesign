We will combine our passions for gaming and artificial intelligence to create an interesting and entertaining experience. We plan to use unreal engine to develop a new game from scratch, incorporating AI in our game. This game will consist of a single player versus a AI controlled fighter that learns over time. From this game we will be able to determine feasibility of including artificially intelligent systems in gaming.
