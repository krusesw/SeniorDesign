### Scope
```
Scope can be challenging to judge at the beginning of a project, yet a very important attribute towards success. 
Our team is in agreement to the scope of our project (with some limitations). We were sure to divide the project
into specific goals that will lead to success. As long as team members are in agreement of these goals throughout
the semester, we aim to have a base functioning game by the end of the Fall. None of us have attempted to create
a game with AI on the unreal engine, so that has a large portion of this projects scope that we will need to 
figure out. Research is very important.
