### Economic Cost
```
This project will have several mandatory costs. Some of these costs will be one time. We will need to purchase 
software liscences for game engine and engine modules created by others (such as the predective AI module for
Unreal). We will also need to pay for any game models we do not create ourselves. Other mandatory costs include
cloud databases / applications we will need to pay for on a monthly basis. We will attempt to get funding from the
school for most of these costs, but some we may have to pay out of pocket.
```
### Time
```
Our team has a detailed plan for the timespan of this project. The main concern with time is not if we are able to
get a game working with AI elements, but wrather how impressive we can make the game with a limited timeframe. Our
plan prioritizes finishing a working product quickly, and expanding and improving upon that product for the remaining
time. Building simpler systems first will allow us to learn how they work, and if the time allows we can improve these
systems.

```
### Scope
```
Scope can be challenging to judge at the beginning of a project, yet a very important attribute towards success. 
Our team is in agreement to the scope of our project (with some limitations). We were sure to divide the project
into specific goals that will lead to success. As long as team members are in agreement of these goals throughout
the semester, we aim to have a base functioning game by the end of the Fall. None of us have attempted to create
a game with AI on the unreal engine, so that has a large portion of this projects scope that we will need to 
figure out. Research is very important. 
```
### Professional/Technical Expertise
```
This project requires technical skills in the category of game development, artificial intelligence, model creation
and manipulation, and software development. Combined as a team, we all have some experience within these specialized
categories. At UC we have taken or are taking software development courses, an AI course, and developed models for 
certain coruses. Our lack of knowledge within the unreal platform may lead to issues along the way, but the internet
and documentation are very helpful and important learning tools.
