All team:
1. Install unreal engine on each compatible device
2. Complete basic unreal training in order to get adapted to the technology
3. Test basic commands that can be expanded into our application
4. Define our codebase layout, and add all assets to our code

Spencer Kruse:
1. Create our project and setup version control - Completed
2. Create proof of concepts for the following project architecture options: - Completed using GIT LFS
    * unreals built in source control
    * perforce server
    * svn server
3. Create cloud database to store game data - Completed but down due to costs
4. Research parallelization of training architecture - Completed
5. Create alpha arena level with unreal editor - In Progress, needs texturing
6. Create training architecture for game AI - In Progress

Nathan Jonas:
1. Review Artificial Intelligence techniques required for our application
2. Research new AI techniques as well that can train against real-time players.
3. Trial these AI techniques to find strengths and weaknesses of certain algorithms
4. Review Unreal documentation related to AI
5. Develop AI techniques into our unreal codebase

Craig Gorney:
1. Examine unreal engine documentation and find key objects that can be utilized
2. Attempt basic game manipulation that can be evolved through experience and research
3. Examine Unreal code architecture and begin development

Jack Osterman:
1. Start creating assets
    * enemy character (our ai)
    * combat system (magic)
    * terrain (blank field with random boxes to start)
2. Review Unreal documentation related to applying assets to our project
3. Display assets within unreal engine, and make these assets useful within our project

Unassigned:
* Find the best modules for back propogation and reinforcement based learning from software trials
* Set up cloud services for scoreboard and user data metrics
