# Reinforcement Learning

We will be implementing reinforcement learning when designing our first person shooter video game. Reinforcement learning 
is a commonly used machine learning technique. We have learned implementation with classic style games such as chess, tic-tac-toe,
and the classic 8-puzzle. Using our knowledge, we will be creating bot controllers for movement and individual contact. 

Generalization is crucial when designing a AI that will gather data and make increasingly better choices throughout combat. Stored
gameplay data is consistently gathered for gameplay decision analysis. Therefore, we can use a premade reinforcement learning library, 
compatible with the Unreal Engine, to sculpt agent behavior through a combination of a neural network and learning models. 

## Key Elements

### Agent
Train a bot to track movement and combat decisions. This agent is a program that tracks user movement and combat data, then makes 
decisions on the data accumulated.

### Environment
Arena based game.

### Action

### Rewards
