### Gameplay 
The game functions similarly to other first-person shooters. The goal is to move around the map, and defeat the enemy character using your weapon, and dodge the enemy attacks. 
Every time you defeat the enemy, a new enemy will spawn in marking the start of a new round. Each new enemy will have updated play patterns based on the reinforcement learning AI. 
The rounds go infinitely high.
