### Strategy/Tips 

The AI controlled enemy player is designed to learn player habits and adapt to overcome your gameplay style. Using the same strategy every round will in term cause the enemy AI to become better against that strategy. To achieve higher rounds, it is recommended to adapt your play habits against what the AI may have learned.

* The following are good beginning tips: 
* Try not to stay in one area of the map for too many rounds. 
* Try not to dodge projectiles the same way every time. 
* Try to switch between aggressive (finding enemy and destroying) and defensive (waiting for enemy to find you) playstyles every few rounds.
