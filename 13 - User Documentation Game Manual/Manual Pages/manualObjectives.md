### Objectives
This game focuses on defeating an enemy that will learn through reinforcement-based learning.  Defeat is defined as landing five total shots on the enemy. If you win, you will continue to infinite rounds until you are defeated. The reinforcement-based learning allows the enemy to accumulate knowledge over time. Therefore, each round becomes more challenging.  

Your objective is to survive as many rounds as you can.
