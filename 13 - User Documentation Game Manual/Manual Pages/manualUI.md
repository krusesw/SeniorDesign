### UI 
The user interface contains two meters. One for health and one for weapon charge. 

#### Health Meter 
 * The health meter appears in the bottom left-hand side of the screen.  
 * It displays a bar with five segments, representing the playerâ€™s five hitpoints.  
 * Each time the player is hit with a projectile, their health will drop by 1 segment. 
 * When this meter reaches 0, the player loses the game. 
 * The health meter resets to full at the start of each round.

 #### Weapon Charge Meter

 * It displays a single bar that fills over the course of two seconds.   
 * Once the meter is filled, the players weapon is ready to fire.  
 * Once the player fires the weapon the meter will empty, and the weapon cannot be fired until the meter is full again.
