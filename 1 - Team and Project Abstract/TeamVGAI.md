## Project Topic
Our plan is to combine our passions for gaming and artificial intelligence to create an interesting and entertaining experience. 
We plan to use unreal engine to develop a new game from scratch, incorporating AI in our game. This game will consist of a single player versus a AI controlled fighter that learns over time.

## Project Goal
Our goal is to create a single level game in which the player is pitted to fight against an AI controlled opponent. The game will 3D and will have FPS (First-Person Shooter) gameplay mechanics. Our goal is to have the AI evolve to eventually be just as good as it's opponent. Specific metrics on this are outlined in the Project Description.

The AI will have to learn to learn the following basic mechanics for each player it fights:

* Maneuver the level to attack the player
* Aim and fire physics based projectiles at the player
* Dodge enemy projectiles

The game also has to be fun, so we have made a goal to hit benchmark user retention rates amongst our playtesters.

Our overarching goal is to determine feasibility of artificially intelligent systems in gaming, specifically in 3D gaming where computing power is limited due to graphical intensity.
