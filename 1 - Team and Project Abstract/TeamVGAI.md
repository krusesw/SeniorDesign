## Project Topic
Our plan is to combine our passions for gaming and artificial intelligence to create an interesting and entertaining experience. 
We plan to use unreal engine to develop a new game from scratch, incorporating AI in our game. Ideas for AI  controled aspects are: enemies, balancing, and level generation. From this game we will be able to determine feasibility of self artificially intelligent systems in gaming.

## Project Goal
Our goal is to create a single level game in which the player is pitted to fight against an AI controlled opponent. The game will be a FPS (First-Person Shooter).
