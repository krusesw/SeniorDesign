#### Senior Design Introduction

Senior design is a wonderful opportunity to showcase the knowledge that I have accumulated over the past four years. I am excited to combine my academic knowledge and my professional knowledge into a single project. My professional experience consists of back-end and front-end software development with an emphasis on React and C#. On the contrary, my group has decided to proceed a project based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Video Game Design. I am excited to learn about this realm of programming and begin researching and developing this project. 

#### Project Guidance (College Experiences)

###### Courses 

I have been impacted my numerous courses throughout my time at the University of Cincinnati. These courses have provided me with an assortment of knowledge, experience, and logical thought processes. A few of the base level courses include: 

* [CS1021] Computer Science 1
* [Math2076] Linear Algebra
* [CS2028] Discrete Structures

These courses created a path for logical thinking and problem solving that led to more advanced technical courses. From there, my knowledge has continued to expand in many directions. Discrete structures, for example, did a great job at combining math into the coding realm. Courses that piece together two large areas of computer science help grasp the larger picture. 

###### Co-op

Cooperative learning is an amazing experience. It has allowed me gain professional experience that is not offered at most other universities. I was able to use skills learned in the classroom in concurrence with my work experience. My accumulated work experience through the co-op program has been:

* Fox Sports: Software Development Co-op (3 semesters)
* Chongqing University: Teaching Assistant (1 semester)
* Kroger Technology and Digital: Software Development Co-op (1 semester)

These experiences have provided me with critical, wonderful experience towards becoming a better software developer and professional. I look forward to putting the technical skills that I have learned towards the upcoming capstone project. 

#### Project Motivation and Excitement

I have wanted to dive into the AI realm for quite some time. I am currently taking the Artificial Intelligence course and relating the theory to code will be a challenging, enjoyable task for this final capstone project. By intertwining AI with video games, I aim to use development and design in their own unique ways. I have been playing video games for quite some time, and being able to do a project using this subject matter will be fun. I have three other teammates who share the same joy as me for this project. 

We are currently planning to use the unreal engine to develop a new game from scratch. We will then be able to incorporate AI into this game that will learn the players habits and (end goal) defeat the player. Our current ideas for AI controlled aspects include enemies, balancing, and level generation. Creating player designs and the game layout will be interesting, and I hope to add some creativity along that process.
