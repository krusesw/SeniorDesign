Individual Capstone Assessment 

Our team’s project will involve incorporating artificial intelligence into video games. We plan to create a system or feature using AI that would make gameplay more enjoyable and optimized. Example ideas include: automatic balancing of in game systems, AI controlled enemies that learn from player patterns over time, and AI generated levels to keep games small but infinite. From an academic standpoint, this project will be intensive in many areas. We will need to write maximum efficiency code and use an intensive amount of computing resources to train the AI. The project may end up graphically intensive as well. This will require knowledge of cloud computing, linear algebra, data analysis, and artificial intelligence training, as well as the chosen game engine (unity or unreal).  

My experiences in my collegiate career will be useful to my team. I have taken and passed all prerequisite math courses (Calculus 1 | MATH1061, Calculus 2 | MATH1062, Linear Algebra | MATH2076, Discrete Computational Structures | CS2071, Probability and Statistics 1 | STAT2037). As building AI requires a solid background in CS related math, these courses will be useful for the project. I am also currently enrolled in Intelligent Data Analysis (CS 5152/6052) as well as Cloud (CS-5165/6065) and Parallel Computing (CS-6068/5168). These courses will teach me on useful ways to view data for AI training, and how to set up the project on a parallel cloud architecture for training. For my python programming course (CS2021), I made a recreation of Tetris with the pygame library, which teaches the basic of video game background systems. My knowledge of concepts such as frames and the basics of graphical representation will be helpful to set up the game portion of this project. 

I’ve also learned much in my work experiences as well. When I worked at Edaptive computing as a junior software developer, I built desktop applications and websites for VHDL model editing. This experience taught me to build legible GUI’s and other easily used systems that interact directly with the user. It also taught me how to write algorithms to automatically draw VHDL models, which could be useful when developing graphical systems for our project. I also worked as a software automation engineer for Honeywell Intelligrated’s QA department. In my job at Honeywell, I was tasked to optimize and build automatic systems for QA department. I parallelized our testing framework, managed docker and Kubernetes clusters, built a database for test results, and built API’s for our systems to communicate with each other. These experiences will prove useful to the project as I now know how to handle processing on a larger scale and keep a database. 

In order to progress smoothly, we will have to start by implementing skeleton systems for our project. Once we have the frame built, we can start to develop the AI. My second step in my design process would be to research and implement proof of concepts for our project. Our project will be split into smaller tasks on a slack board. Developing multiple small pieces of code as proof of concept pieces and ironing our bugs once we decide to implement the features will lead to a more optimized project. We will need to evaluate our progress often and will implement a weekly/biweekly meeting to discuss and evaluate progress. This project is a massive undertaking and will require careful planning and dedication on our part to see success. 

I am motivated to work on this project because I have always enjoyed video games from a young age, and it is my dream to work in the field. I also have an interest in AI, and believe it holds the keys to our future. This project is a perfect combination of the reasons I like computer science and my hobbies. Our end goal should be to deliver a project that enhances a single aspect of video gaming with the use of artificial intelligence. I do not feel as if we need to create perfect systems, as the nature of artificial intelligence does not breed perfection quickly. I think the project will be completed when it has a considerably impressive accuracy for correctness (depending on the situation the AI is determining) and is entertaining to play with, or against.
